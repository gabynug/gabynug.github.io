<ul class = "exerciselist">
    <li><a href = "exercises/exercise1.html">Exercise #1 - About Me</a>
    </li>
     <p>My first exercise in which I designed a very rough version of my About Me page. I learned how to include images, link words and include text in a webpage.</p>
    <li><a href = "exercises/exercise2.html">Exercise #2 - Resume</a></li>
    <p>This exercise allowed me to lay out a base for my resume page while practicing the same skills that I learned in the first project.</p>
    <li>Exercise Page (current page)</li>
    <p>This page allowed me to list and link my exercises in a clear and concise manner.</p>
    <li><a href = "exercises/exercise4.html">Exercise #4 - Photo Basics</a></li>
    <p>In preparation for creating a client website, we were asked to select three images that we could use on three possible websites. I worked on finding non-copyrighted images and using links.</p>
    <li><a href = "exercises/exercise5.html">Exercise #5 - CSS Color</a>
    </li>
    <p>This exercise taught me how to create and apply a css file to a webpage. I added color to my about me from exercise #1.</p>
    <li><a href = "exercises/exercise5-resume.html">Exercise #5 - Resume</a></li>
    <p>Just like the exercise above, I applied css to my resume from exercise #2.</p>
    <li><a href = "exercises/exercise6.html">Exercise #6 - CSS Typography</a></li>
    <p>I learned where to find different fonts and how to imbed them into a page as well as link to them in the css. </p>
    <li><a href = "exercises/exercise7.html">Exercise #7 - CSS Box Model</a></li>
    <p>This exercise prepared me for my samples page and taught me how to make buttons as well as add color to font.</p>
    <li><a href = "exercises/exercise8.html">Exercise #8 - Float Layout</a></li>
    <p>I practiced my float skills here as well and focused on structuring my about me page from exercise #1. </p>
    <li><a href = "exercises/grid.html">Exercise #9 - Grid Layout</a></li>
    <p>This exericse taught me how to use asides and sections in order to create a colorful grid. For extra credit we were asked to include an interwoven yellow strip.</p>
