<p class = "aboutp">My name is Gabriella (Gaby) Nugent. I am a sophomore Informatics student attending UMass Amherst and I'm from Newton, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. I love watching movies, reading and writing. I also enjoy learning about html and CSS and am fascinated by the overlap between technology and art. I would love to someday work for a magazine like iD or Dazed and Confused Magazine! I also <b>love</b> music and am always looking for new artists to listen to!
<br><a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Y2tdB9QZ6TqdiqyNWwnHt?si=dvuAv6N-Rpu04mGARAttkA" target="_blank"> Here's a link to my favorite Spotify playlist</a>
<br>I have worked in a variety of places including a nursing home, cinema and a children's day care and these jobs have all taught me important things about patience and working hard to complete goals. I am passionate about pop culture and art and love learning new things! </p>
