        <p class = "indpara">
            This project is a visual analysis on fashion through the ages and its influence on modern fashion. I try to look at how society is beginning to lean on vintage fashion trends as well as how this facilitates sustainability through the recent surge in thrift shopping. This project was created through Adobe InDesign.

        <p class = "indpara"> 
            This is an example of a mock business card and resume. I used Adobe InDesign for this project and created it for a class last year that was centered around learning about the Adobe Creative Suite.

        <p class = "indpara">
            This image was one of the first projects created in my Adobe class and it shows a boy observing a piece of art, but it looks almost as if he is peeking into this womenâ€™s bathhouse. I like it because it looks as if some of the women are reacting to the boy even though it is just a painting.

        <p class = "indpara">     
            This last piece of work is an extra credit essay that I wrote for my informatics class about how sets are used very frequently in life, notably in applications such as Spotify.
